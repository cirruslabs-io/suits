# Lab Test Packages Management

## Lab Test Packages List

In the Lab Test Packages section, the admin can view a list of packages that includes various details such as Package name, Lab Test categories associated with each package, the number of parameters included in the package, price, and status.

The admin has the ability to search for specific packages by entering the Package name into the search function. This search functionality allows the admin to quickly locate and access the desired lab test package within the list.

Additionally, the admin can filter the package list based on Lab Test categories. By selecting a specific category from the provided list of categories, the admin can filter the displayed packages to show only those that belong to the chosen category. This filtering feature assists in organizing and managing lab test packages based on their respective categories.

Moreover, the admin can filter the table list based on the status of the packages. The available options for status are typically "Active" and "Inactive." By selecting the desired status option, the admin can filter the list to display only the packages that match the chosen status. This filtering capability aids in managing and analyzing packages based on their current availability or operational status.

By utilizing the search and filter options, the admin can efficiently navigate and interact with the Lab Test Packages list, making it easier to find specific packages and perform relevant administrative tasks as necessary.
