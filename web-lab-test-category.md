# Lab Test Category Management

## Lab Test Category List

The Lab Test Category List displays various details in a table format, including the Category Name, associated image, the number of packages available in general for each category, and the status of each category.

The admin has the ability to search for specific categories by entering the Category Name into the search function. This search functionality allows the admin to quickly locate and access the desired lab test category within the list.

Additionally, the admin can filter the lab test categories based on their status, which can be classified as "Active" or "Inactive." By selecting the respective filter option, the admin can refine the displayed list to show only the lab test categories that match the chosen status. This filtering feature aids in organizing and managing lab test categories based on their availability or operational status.

By utilizing the search and filter options, the admin can efficiently navigate and interact with the Lab Test Category List, making it easier to find specific categories and perform relevant administrative tasks as necessary.
