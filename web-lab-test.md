# Lab Tests Management

## Lab Tests

The admin has the option to view the lab test details on a separate page, where they can access information such as the lab test name, description, and status.

On the lab test details page, the admin can search for a specific lab test by entering the lab test name into the search function. This search functionality allows the admin to quickly locate and access the desired lab test within the list.

Additionally, the admin can filter the lab tests based on their status, which can be classified as "Active" or "Inactive." By selecting the respective filter option, the admin can refine the displayed lab tests to show only those that match the chosen status. This filtering feature helps in organizing and managing lab tests based on their availability or operational status.

By utilizing the search and filter options, the admin can efficiently navigate and explore the lab test details, making it easier to find specific lab tests and analyze their descriptions and statuses. This allows for effective lab test management and decision-making processes.
