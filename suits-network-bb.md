## Add New Blood Bank

The admin has the option to click on "Add Blood Bank" and will be presented with two methods to add a blood bank: bulk upload and individual upload.

- Bulk Upload: This option allows the admin to upload multiple blood banks simultaneously using a bulk upload feature. Typically, the admin can prepare a file or spreadsheet containing the details of multiple blood banks, such as name, location, contact information, and other relevant data. They can then select this file and upload it to the system, which will automatically add all the blood banks listed in the file.

- Individual Upload: With this option, the admin can manually enter the details of each blood bank one by one. They will be presented with a form or interface where they can input the specific information for each blood bank, such as name, location, contact details, and any other required fields. The admin can fill out the form for each blood bank individually and submit the information to add them to the system.

These two options provide flexibility to the admin in adding blood banks to the system. The bulk upload feature is useful for adding multiple blood banks quickly, while the individual upload option allows for a more detailed and controlled entry of each blood bank's information.
