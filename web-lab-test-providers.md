# Lab Test Provider Management

## Lab Test Provider List

The website will showcase a list of lab test providers, including their provider name, associated image, and status.

The admin has the capability to search for specific lab test providers by entering the provider name into the search function. This search functionality enables the admin to quickly locate and access the desired lab test provider within the list.

Moreover, the admin can filter the lab test providers based on their status, which can be classified as "Active" or "Inactive." By selecting the respective filter option, the admin can refine the displayed list to show only the lab test providers that match the chosen status. This filtering feature aids in organizing and managing lab test providers based on their availability or operational status.

By leveraging the search and filter options, the admin can efficiently navigate and interact with the list of lab test providers, making it easier to find specific providers and perform relevant administrative tasks as necessary.
