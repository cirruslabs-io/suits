## Add New Coupon

The admin can add a new coupon by clicking on the "Add New Coupon" button.

Upon selecting the "Add New Coupon" button, the admin will be directed to a page or a form specifically designed for creating a new coupon. On this page, the admin will be prompted to provide various details and settings for the coupon.

These details typically include:

- Coupon Code: Enter a unique code that customers can use to apply the coupon during checkout.

- Coupon Name: Provide a descriptive name or title for the coupon.

- Coupon Type: Specify the type of discount or offer the coupon provides, such as a percentage discount, fixed amount discount, free shipping, etc.

- Discount Type: Choose whether the discount is applied as a percentage or a fixed amount.

- Duration: Set the start and end dates for the coupon's validity period.

- User Limit: Optionally, specify a maximum number of times the coupon can be used per user.

## Delete Coupon

The admin has the ability to delete a coupon by clicking on the delete icon associated with that particular coupon.

When the admin locates the coupon they wish to remove from the list, they can click on the delete icon linked to that coupon. By clicking on this icon, the admin triggers the deletion process for that specific coupon.

Typically, a confirmation prompt will appear to ensure that the deletion is intentional and to prevent accidental removal of the coupon.

Once the admin confirms the deletion, the coupon will be permanently removed from the system. This action also includes the removal of any associated data or records tied to that coupon.

It's important to exercise caution when deleting a coupon, as the process is irreversible, and the data cannot be easily recovered unless there are backups or archival systems in place.

By utilizing the delete icon, the admin can effectively manage the coupons and remove any outdated, expired, or unnecessary coupons from the system, ensuring a streamlined and up-to-date coupon list.
