## Dashboard

The Doctor Dashboard page contains detailed information about doctors, including their specialization and experience. There are four main menus available for doctors to access patient details: All Appointments, Online Consultations, Offline Consultations, and Availability.

## View/Update Profile

After clicking on the "Edit Profile" button, doctors will be directed to the Edit Profile page where they can view their existing details. It is mandatory for every doctor to opt-in for G-meet to conduct online consultations. They must also register and synchronize their Google Calendar to receive updates regarding online consultation meeting schedules.

By having the option to edit these aspects, doctors can ensure that their profile remains up to date and accurately reflects their current status, achievements, and expertise. This flexibility allows doctors to manage their online presence effectively and provide the most relevant and accurate information to patients and colleagues.
